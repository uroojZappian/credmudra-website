                <p>
                    This Section summarises the rights that you have in respect of your data. Please note that some of the rights
                    available to you are subject to the requirements of the applicable law. You may peruse the relevant laws for a
                    complete understanding your rights. Your principal rights concerning your personal data are as below:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Right to access: You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and,
                        where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional
                        information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned
                        and the recipients of the personal data. Subject to the condition that the rights and freedoms of others are
                        not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of
                        charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Right to rectification: You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and,
                        taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you
                        completed.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Right to erasure: In certain circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without
                        undue delay. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where
                        processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance
                        with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Right to restrict processing: In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your
                        personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is
                        unlawful but you do not desire erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our
                        processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and
                        you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been
                        restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise
                        process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the
                        protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Right to object to processing: In some circumstances, you have the right to object to our processing of your
                        personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis
                        for the processing is that the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the
                        public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate
                        interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the
                        personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which
                        override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or
                        defence of legal claims.

                    profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal

                    purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is
                    necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.

                    <li>
                        Right to data portability: To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:
                        (a) consent; or (b) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are
                        party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is
                        carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured,
                        commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely
                        affect the legal or contractual rights of third-parties or where the law requires otherwise.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by a written notice to us. In order for us
                    to comply with your request, your notice must clearly state the right that you wish to exercise and identify
                    your information in respect of which you wish to exercise such right. Please note that as a security measure, we
