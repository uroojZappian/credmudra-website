                            <h2>Factors Influencing Personal Loan Eligibility</h2>
                            <p>Wondering which factors can have a prominent effect on the personal loan eligibility criteria? Here are some of the primary ones that have a notable effect on your personal credit eligibility:</p>
                            <ul>

                                <li><span>Credit Score:</span> Personal loan, being an unsecured credit type demands a higher CIBIL score. This assures creditors that you are a trustworthy borrower and they can expect you to pay your monthly instalments on time. Since no collateral is involved, it is vital to maintain a score of 700 and above.</li>
                                <li><span>Age bar:</span> As you have already seen that most of the lenders have set the minimum age bar to 21 years, it becomes mandatory to have reached it to get approval. Also, you must ensure that your maximum age at the time you complete loan repayment should be 58 or as the lender specifies.</li>
                                <li><span>Minimum income:</span> If a borrower has a high income, lenders are sure that you will have sufficient cash to pay an increased monthly instalment. So, you can easily go for a sumptuous credit amount. On the contrary, if your monthly salary is less or below the minimum income bar, there are chances of rejection of credit application.</li>
                                <li><span>Repayment capacity:</span> While reviewing your personal loan application, lenders check the liabilities that you already have. If you have multiple credits to repay at the time of loan application, lenders realise that it can pose a financial burden to repay another credit. So, they might reject your application or lower the allowed credit amount.</li>
                                <li><span>Business or working experience:</span> Several financial institutions have set a minimum work experience of two years or more as an eligibility criterion for salaried individuals. Also, some lenders demand a business vintage of 3 years, which self-employed individuals need to fulfil to stand eligible for credit approval.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>How Can You Boost Your Personal Loan Eligibility?</h2>
                            <p>Worried about getting low personal loan approval due to the impact of the above factors? Here are some of the sure-shot steps that you can take for improving your <b> personal loan eligibility:</b></p>

                            <ul>


                                <li><span>Nationality:</span> Go for a co-applicant or guarantor: In case you have a low CIBIL score and want a personal loan urgently, you can request your friends or family members with a good CIBIL score to be your co-applicant or even a guarantor. This can lead to a prompt improvement in your personal loan eligibility and approval of credit application.</li>
                                <li><span>Refrain from frequent job switches:</span> Wondering why frequent job switches hamper your loan eligibility? If you keep changing your job again and again, lenders are not able to estimate your monthly income and view you as a high-risk borrower. Hence, it would be prudent to avoid changing your job randomly.</li>
                                <li><span>Maintain a credit score above 750:</span> A credit score above 750 makes lenders believe that you are an ardent financial planner having good experience in repaying your credits. However, if you have a lower score, try to take some effective steps to improve it immediately and fulfil the loan eligibility criteria.</li>
                                <li><span>Do not for multiple loan applications:</span> If you already have more than one credit to repay, it can pose a financial burden to pay EMIs for all. Also, at times it can make you miss out on the monthly instalment date, leading to lowering of your CIBIL score. Thus, it would be prudent to apply for credit only when needed.</li>
                                <li><span>Create sources of additional income:</span> Creating additional sources of income allows you to earn extra every month. This eases the payment of monthly instalments on time. In view of this, creditors will see you as a more eligible candidate and approve your loan immediately after application.</li>
                            </ul>
